so the initial idea is to create a encoder/decoder that encodes the input string to a long
number on the basis of ascii values. Just got the idea, lets see how this will turn out.

Will have to check if there is an existing mapping of ascii values in java (should be there)

just wrote the core logic for converting the input string to ascii for encoding and vice versa for decoding.
write now I'm converting the input string to uppercase first before converting to ascii values as the ascii
values A-Z are 2 digit, along with whitespace(32) which will be helpful/easy while decoding to plain text.
